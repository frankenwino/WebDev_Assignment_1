# Assignment 1

**Recreate a website**

In this assignment, you are tasked with recreating a website's structure, design, and responsiveness! Interactivity is not important here; instead, you should focus solely on the visual aspects with an emphasis on responsiveness.

The submission is individual. Read through the entire assignment description carefully. Then choose a website to recreate - remember that it should not be too simple but should include several major elements such as a header, sidebar, footer, as well as texts and images. Also, consider that only what you can see on the website's homepage should be recreated - nothing else. If you are unsure if the website you have chosen is suitable, you can request approval during class time. Recreating a website that is too simple may be rejected (e.g., www.vecka.nu). Examples of websites to recreate:

- www.apple.com
- www.spotify.se
- www.youtube.com

If the page you've chosen has a lot of repetitive content on the homepage (e.g., all the videos on YouTube, or all sections on apple.com), you can delimit and choose a part of the content to recreate.

Once you've decided on a website, it's time to organize your work. Create a project folder for the assignment where you gather everything related to the task. Then open the folder in VS code and create an index.html file for your html code and one or more .css files for your css code. Now it's time to start coding, and it may be helpful to break down the task into different parts, such as thinking about what main elements the website consists of and focusing on recreating those first. This is to ensure you have enough time to capture the website's responsiveness and not spend the majority of the time on details.

Remember that all files and folders should be named clearly so that it is evident what they are for; if this is neglected, the assignment may be rejected. This also applies to the names of the screenshots you are supposed to take.

**Requirements for passing:**

-[x] Your project folder contains at least one HTML file and one CSS file, as well as a README.md

-[x] In the README.md file, it should be clear which page you have chosen to recreate and any limitations you have chosen to make and why, a link to the original website, and your name.

-[x] Git and Github have been used (the repository should be public so that I can access it)

-[x] At least one screenshot of the original website's appearance should be in your project folder

-[ ] The elements on the page should be responsive enough to stay visible in the image

-[ ] Colors, sizes, and distances should be similar to the original website's

-[ ] The assignment must be submitted on time! (the project folder is zipped and submitted in the learning platform as a group)

**Requirements for passing with distinction:**

-[ ] The requirements for passing are met

-[ ] The elements on the page should be fully responsive - matching the original website's responsiveness

-[ ] There should be several screenshots of the original website's appearance for different screen sizes - at least one for mobile, one for tablet, and one for desktop.

-[ ] Colors, sizes, and distances should match the original website's

-[ ] An icon set (css file from FontAwesome or MaterialUI) should be loaded into the head tag, icons from the file should then be used in at least one place in the html code.

-[ ] The code should be logically structured with clear comments for its construction

**Mini-glossary:**

- Responsiveness - describes a page's ability to adapt to different screen sizes and devices.\*
- Interactivity - the computer's ability to respond to user input (e.g., button presses).
- Structure - the internal organization of a system.
