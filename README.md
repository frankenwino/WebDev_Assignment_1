**Site:** [bleedingskull.com](http://bleedingskull.com)

**Why I chose this site**

- The site is responsive and, as per the requirements, contains a header, footer, as well as texts and images.
- There were multiple areas which required their own flex container which provided an opportuntity to practise handling multiple flex containers on the same page.
- The site supports 5 different screen sizes which provided an opportunity to practise media queries.
- The site uses icons in the nav area which provied an opportunity to use third party icons.

**Limitations:** No sidebar on the original site
